# 🍊 OrangeHRM Automated Test Suite

A comprehensive automation testing project built for the OrangeHRM web application, demonstrating strong proficiency in industry-standard tools and framework design.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Expertise

* **Automation:** **Selenium WebDriver** (Java)
* **Framework:** **TestNG** (Used for test organization, prioritization, and execution management)
* **Build Tool:** **Maven** (For streamlined dependency management)
* **IDE:** Eclipse
* **Version Control:** Git

## ⚙️ Key Framework Features

* **Modular Design:** Implemented reusable methods (e.g., `openModule()`) to significantly reduce code duplication and enhance maintainability.
* **Synchronization:** Utilized **Explicit Waits (`WebDriverWait`)** for stable test execution, effectively handling dynamic web elements.
* **Data Handling:** Implemented robust data validation, assertions, and custom reporting for execution clarity.
* **Test Suite Structure:** Converted the project to a **Maven framework** for efficient dependency handling and build automation.

## 🎯 Testing Scope

The suite provides near-complete functional and regression coverage across major OrangeHRM modules:

* **Authentication:** Login/Logout, Session Handling
* **Core Modules:** Admin, PIM, Leave, Time, Recruitment, My Info
* **Functionality:** Verified navigation, data submission (Positive/Negative), and CRUD operations (Add/Edit/Delete Emergency Contacts).

## 📊 Results and Impact

* **Total Coverage:** Successfully executed **30 automated test cases**.
* **Test Types:** Demonstrated expertise in Functional, Regression, Retesting, and Positive/Negative testing methodologies.
* **Valuable Findings:** Detected genuine application issues, such as validation gaps in specific fields (e.g., numeric input acceptance for names).
* **Professional Practice:** Code exemplifies real-world automation practices including modularization and assertion-based verification.
